# GenieACS-QT-smallGUI
Small GUI enables fast configuration changes on supported devices.
# Use Case
Instead of searching correct configuration in GenieACS we can access only selected preprogrammed options for devices.
Any model working with GenieACS can be added by editing cpewindow.cpp. Now GUI supports TP-Link DECO M4R, other devices will be displayed without ability to edit any settings
